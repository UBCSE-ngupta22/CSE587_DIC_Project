# CSE 587: Data Intensive Computing Project


## Phase 1 (currently in progress)


### Deliverables
1. Problem Statement: Form a title and problem statement that clearly state the problem 
and questions you are trying to answer. Additionally: 
    - [5 marks] Discuss the background of the problem leading to your objectives. Why is it a significant problem?
    - [5 marks] Explain the potential of your project to contribute to your problem domain. Discuss why this contribution is crucial?  

2. Data Sources [5 marks]: Collect your data. Your data can come from multiple sources. 
For example, Medical, Bank, sports, health, Kaggle, Amazon reviews, Twitter, Youtube, 
Reddit, etc. This data has to be large enough for the data analysis to yield significance. 
At least 2000 rows/records. Although there is no requirement for the number of columns, 
as this will vary based on project, your data should contain enough columns to 
successfully complete the deliverables for Phase 1. If your data is already clean, or does 
not have a sufficient number of columns to complete Phase 1, you must find 
different/additional data sources. You must cite and link your data sources in the 
report. 

3. Data Cleaning/Processing [10 Marks]: Your dataset has to be cleaned and properly 
processed. Please submit a report where you explain each processing/cleaning step 
properly. We expect to see comments and markup for this step. In order to get full marks 
you must clearly document 7 (10 for 587 students) distinct processing/cleaning 
operations. 

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) [25 Marks]: Perform exploratory data analysis as 
defined in the NIST publication [2] and as originally described by John Tukey [3]. Record the outcomes and what you learned and how you will use this information. For example, 
in choosing features (columns) and dropping columns, and in short feature engineering. 
You need to demonstrate 7 (10 for 587 students) different, significant and relevant EDA 
operations and describe how you used these to process the data sets further to  
provision them for downstream modeling and analytics. Figures and tables should be 
included where relevant.
